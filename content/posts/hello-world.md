Local favorite. The *rumor* is that 100% of all startups have their first meeting here. Great place to work on a Friday morning when you first get in town overlooking the start Lake Austin. Live music if you're lucky.

#### Our personal favorites:

1. Draft Latte
2. Vietnamese Iced Coffee
3. Raspberry Chocolate Pop-Tart
