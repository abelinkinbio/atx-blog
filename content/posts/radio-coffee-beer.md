A little bit too far out for a weekend trip, but a great vibe if you're looking to knock out some  quick work. Grab a taco from one of our favorite trucks and a local beer as a reward for being productive.

#### Our personal favorites:

1. Thai Iced Tea
2. Migas Taco (Veracruz)
3. Live Oak Hefe (Beer on Tap)
